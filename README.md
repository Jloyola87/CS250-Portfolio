##  Artifact: Sprint Review and Retrospective
This artifact includes the **Sprint Review and Retrospective** deliverable from the final Vision Quest Software project. It highlights my experience working within the Agile framework and demonstrates how I applied Scrum practices like sprint planning, team roles, and reflection. This project helped me understand how Agile keeps development flexible and focused on delivering value through collaboration and continuous improvement.

## Reflection

### 1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Understanding user needs starts with focusing on the problem they’re trying to solve. User stories make that process clearer by translating goals into small, focused tasks that are easy to build and test. Each story keeps the user at the center, which helps guide development decisions and ensures that what we create actually meets their expectations.

### 2. How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach development as an ongoing process of planning, building, testing, and improving. Agile gives structure to that cycle. I plan to keep using short sprints, daily standups, and retrospectives to stay organized and adaptive. Working in iterations makes it easier to catch problems early and adjust based on feedback instead of waiting until the end of a project.

### 3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member communicates openly, meets deadlines, and supports others when challenges come up. It’s about being dependable and willing to help the team succeed rather than just focusing on your own work. Agile depends on collaboration, so staying flexible, respectful, and accountable makes the whole group stronger.
